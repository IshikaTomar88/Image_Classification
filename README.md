# Image_Classification
 Image Classification using CNN
This project builds a deep learning image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It covers the full workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, with visualizations and insights.

# Features
CNN-based architecture for image classification

Supports custom or public datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST)

Visual performance metrics (accuracy, loss)

Clean, modular codebase

Easily extendable for more complex tasks

#🧹 Data Preprocessing
Before training, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure optimal learning performance:

Resizing: All images are resized to a uniform shape (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64)

Normalization: Pixel values scaled to range [0, 1] or standardized to zero mean and unit variance

One-Hot Encoding: Class labels converted into one-hot vectors (for multi-class classification)

Augmentation (optional):

Random rotation

Horizontal flip

Zoom and shift

Brightness adjustment

Example using Torchvision or Keras ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation.

# 💡 Insights
🔍 Observations from Training:
Overfitting started to appear after epoch 15, especially without data augmentation or dropout.

Data augmentation and Dropout (0.5) improved generalization significantly.

Validation accuracy stabilized quickly, suggesting good data balance.

Misclassified images were often visually ambiguous even to humans.

# 📊 Class Imbalance:
If using a custom dataset, class imbalance can be visualized and addressed with:

Oversampling

Class weighting in loss function

Data augmentation on minority classes

# 🚀 Result
* Metric	Train	Validation
* Accuracy	98.7%	92.3%
* Loss	0.07	0.29

Achieved using CIFAR-10 with data augmentation for 20 epochs and Adam optimizer.
